<h3>News</h3></center>
<hr>
<b>1.17.01</b> Year 2 of the Pok&#233mon Trading Card Game League began on January 6.  I participate at a nearby Toys 'R' Us.  All US Toys 'R' Us stores should be participating (<a href="mailto:GymLeaderZap@msn.com">let me know</a> if you find one that isn't).  For more info, go to <a href="http://www.wizards.com/pokemon">wizards.com/pokemon</a> for more info.
<p><b>1.31.01</b> If you like to keep up-to-date with the newest Pok&#233mon product releases, then you should already have at least one pack of Neo Genesis cards.  One way to describe it: if the Team Rocket and Gym Leader sets bent the rules, the Neo sets will snap them in half and blow them to bits.  There's a lot mor stuff to keep track of, like the Baby Pok&#233mon rule, and Scorch marks.  Also, some cards evolve from Pok&#233mon that were already released as cards, like Bellossom (from Gloom) ar Politoed (from Poliwhirl).  I only have 22 cards, but I plan on getting more soon.  (I think that there should also be two more Neo sets, like there are in Japan!)
<p><b>2.04.01</b> This just in: Pok&#233mon Stadium 2 should be released late in March (I heard it would be the 28th).  Stadium 2 will have all of the same 3-D graphics and simple control ability, but it will also be campatible with Pok&#233mon Gold & Silver.
<p><b>2.22.01</b> Sorry I haven't updated my page in a while, but today I got some really good news.  Most of it is on my new <a href="release.html">release date</a> page, but I still could fit some in here.  Pok&#233mon was at number 11 on the Lycos search engine count (Valentines Day, Dragonball Z, and the IRS (don't ask why) were the top 3).  The opening day parade for the Toy Fair 2001 was ruled by Pok&#233mon.  According to a report from <a href="http://www.pojo.com/news/NewsFeb14.01.html">pojo.com</a>, "ten customized Pok&#233mon vehicles--Lugia PT Cruisers and Pikachu Beetles also joined the show.  At the end of the parade route, the Pok&#233mon crew performed "My Best Friend" from the hit stage show "Pok&#233mon Live."  Photos can be found at <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/news/parade.html">http://www.pokemon.com/news/parade.html</a>.  In 2000, 3/5 (or 6) of the top 10 bestselling video games were Pok&#233mon, representing 12 percent of total video game sales.  I guess that's it!  (Whew, I thought that would go on forever!)
<p><b>2.28.01</b> Have you heard the news story about the Pok&#233mon episode that wasn't translated into English because it reportedly sent hundreds of children to the hospital in epileptic seziures?  Well, according to the Southern Medical Journal, "There's no question that there were at least some epileptic children who were affected....The answer is that...it triggered a case of mass hysteria."  For a complete report on the subject, go to <a href="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/24867.htm">http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/24867.htm</a>.  A later report by Kit Kiefer (author of the story that I got this from (thanx, Kit!)) said that "Doctors first said the seziures were photosensitive epilepsy, caused by a scene in the cartoon that included a series of strobe-like flashes....Experts now say only a small fraction of the kids actually had photosensitive epilepsy and the rest were reflecting the mass hysteria that surrounded the event."  On a lighter side, Pok&#233mon was up to 9th on the Lycos network search engine.  Harry Potter was at 23rd.  (And I thought last weeks news would go on forever!)
<p><b>4.16.01</b> I haven't updated in a long time!  I added a <a href="index.html">contest</a>, and I'm holding the thickest stack of Pok&#233mon news I've ever held (must be half a centimeter thick!)!  If you haven't heard, Saudi Arabia has issued a fatwa (or ban) against Pok&#233mon, claiming that it "possessed the minds of Arabian children, and promotes gambling, Israel, and is 'un-Islamic.'"  Nintendo claims that there was no intention to be disrespectful to certain religions and that nothing associated with Pok&#233mon was associated with any form of religion.  For more info, visit <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010326/wl/saudi_pokemon_3.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010327/wl/saudi_pokemon_3.html</a>, <a href="http://www.arabia.com/article/0,1690,Life|42654,00.html">http://www.arabia.com/article/0,1690,Life|42654,00.html</a>, and <a href="http://www.dailynews.yahoo.com/h/abc/20010326/wl/pokemon010326_1.html">http://www.dailynews.yahoo.com/h/abc/20010326/wl/pokemon010326_1.html</a>.  The latest winners of the Nintendo Pikachu Beetle contest were featured on the Rosie O'Donnell show.

The Pok&#233mon Stadium 2 web page is up.  See it at <a href="http://www.pokemonstadium.com/stadium2/index.html">http://www.pokemonstadium.com/stadium2/index.html</a>.  I have scans of the two newest Pok&#233mon TCG promos up at <a href="images/promo cards 34+35.jpg">images/promo cards 34+35.jpg</a>.  Gotta go now; it's past my bedtime!
<p><b>5.13.01</b> Been almost a month since my last update!  I got a truckload of news for ya, along with a bunch o' new scans.  One of the scans is of a page of the Pok&#233mon TCG league Year 2 book (it's from my own book!).  Click <a href="images/pokecardleaguepage.jpg">here</a> to see it.  As of May 6, Pok&#233mon Stadium 2 was the #1 video game rental.  As of May 6, Pok&#233mon was 7th on the Lycos search database.  Rumors say that more 'shiny' Pok&#233mon, like Gyarados and Magikarp from Neo 3, will appear in Neo 4 (to see a Togepi card from Neo 4, click <a href="images/neo4togepi.jpg">here</a>).  Pok&#233mon Crystal's release has been advanced to July 30.  The new top priced Pok&#233mon card in the world is Gold Mewtwo, passing up Base Set 1 Charizard with a $260 tag on E-bay.  The newest major Pok&#233mon website site is up: <a href="http://www.pokemon2001.com">http://www.pokemon2001.com</a>. It has all the latest info on the fourth Pok&#233mon movie, but it's in Japanese, but on the other hand, it has lots of cool pictures!  Neo 4 is on sale in Japan now (see above).  CoroCoro Comics in Japan has released a "Shining Mew" promo card (click <a href="images/shiningmewPromo.jpg">here</a> to see it).  Rumors say that Pok&#233mon #151 will play an important role in the fourth Pok&#233mon movie.  I have a picture from the April 21 issue of the <a href="http://www.pojo.com/news/News-April21-2001.html">pojo.com</a> news: "Black Mewtwo" from Neo 4.  Click <a href="images/Black_Mewtwo_neo4_.jpg">here</a> to see it!  Nintendo has pushed back the date for the Japanese release of its Game Cube from July to September 14.  That should also affect the US release.  After only 10 days on the screen, Pok&#233mon 3: The Movie has fetched almost 13 million dollars!  Get this--some kid named Nick put a Mew decal on his Boy Scout pinewood derby car and won first place!  I wonder why I didn't think of that last year.  Mike from Taiwan gave <a href="http://pojo.com/news/NewsApril15.01.html">pojo.com</a> a scan of the Shining Celebi card from Neo 4 (if you haven't noticed, I'm only putting news up in the order I'm getting it!); click <a href="images/NEO4_ShiningCelebi_Eng.jpg">here</a> to see it.  The new Scizor promo card for the Pok&#233mon TCG league is here; click <a href="images/scizorPromo.jpg">here</a> to see it.  To see the previous 4 Pok&#233mon TCG league promos, click <a href="images/promo_cards_30to32_36.jpg">here</a>.  Two more pics on <a href="http://www.pojo.com/pokemon.html">pojo.com</a>: Pok&#233mon TCG 2 for GameBoy promos from AJ (click <a href="images/gb2Promos_fromAJ.jpg">here</a>) and 3 new Pok&#233mon from Tim (click <a href="images/3newpokesL_fromTim.jpg">here</a>). Man, that's the most news I've ever seen in a LONG time!
<p><b>6.21.01</b> The first set of GameBoy Advance have sold out (;_;)!  Still, there's a silver lining in every cloud, and the silver lining here was that the Target I was looking for GameBoy Advance at was taking reservations for Pok&#233mon Crystal (^_^)!  Click <a href="images/Pokemon_Crystal_Reserve.jpg">here</a> to see the reserve ticket (don't even TRY to counterfeit it; I've electronically voided my scan about 5 times!) and <a href="images/Pokemon_Crystal_box.jpg">here</a> for a scan of the box!  Note: Pok&#233mon Crystal will be compatible with Pok&#233mon Stadium 2.<br>
<img src="images/pokemongreenFAKE.jpg" align=right>Ever see something like the picture at right and wanted to buy it?  Don't--it's fake.  Yes, once again, the criminal mind has succeded in producing a false Pok&#233mon product, but failed to make it convincing enough for moi.  Last I knew it was selling on E-bay, but don't look into getting it.  Pok&#233mon Green always has, is, and probably always will be a Japan-specific game.<br>
On a lighter note, I saw a snippet from <a href="http://www.pokemonzeo.com">pokemonzeo.com</a> about Pokemon VS, a new, reformatted card expansion of the Pok&#233mon TCG!  As far as I know, there are no new rules, but a whole TON of new cards, including 16 NEW gym decks and Elite Four decks, as well as Japan's FIRST 1st Edition cards!!!!  Here's a list of some images I have:
<ul>

</ul>
News on Pok&#233mon Advance, which won't debut for at LEAST a year and a half: it'll have improved graphics, new badges, and about !200! new Pok&#233mon!<br>
The only image of my own today is the Pok&#233mon Crystal reserve ticket.  All the others are from the <a href="http://www.pojo.com/news">pojo.com news files</a>.
<p>
<b>7.19.01</b> Before you read today's news, have you ever wondered how I organize all of the news I put on this site?  If so, <a href="news_71801_notes.txt">here's</a> how!  Now, back to our regularly scheduled news.  According to Glenn at <a href="http://www.japanime.com">japanime.com</a>, at the end of the fourth Pok&#233mon movie, there is a fifteen-second trailer for the fifth--yes, fifth--Pok&#233mon movie!  There is life out there....sorry.  Anyway, Pok&#233mon 4 is out in Japan; click <a href="images/Celebi4Movie_cardpics.jpg">here</a> to see some cards with screenshots on them (from <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/willis778/MainframeMyhomepage.html">hometown.aol.com/willis778/MainframeMyhomepage.html</a>)!  The PS2 hard disk is coming out soon.  <a href="http://www.pokemoncrystal.com">pokemoncrystal.com</a> is out.  The Pok&#233mon 3 The Movie VHS/DVD release is August 21; it'll feature an <a href="images/UnownJ.jpg">Unown "J"</a> promo card, a Pok&#233mon 4 movie trailer (hopefully, in English), facts about the "To Know the Unown" music video, the new Pok&#233rap, commentary from some filmmakers, various little-known facts about the Unown, a decoder coin, and full-screen format.  Pok&#233mon TCG for GameBoy 2 will supposedly be called "Return of the Rockets."  Team Rocket takes over the Pok&#233mon card world, and the goal is to collect all 500 cards and beat all eight trainer clubs.  It'll probably have the cards from between Base 1 and Gym 2.  <a href="Pokemon_Crystal_description.html">Here's</a> a description of Pok&#233mon Crystal (to be released August 1) from <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">nintendo.com</a> and some pictures: <a href="images/Pokemon_Crystal_battletower_ss.jpg">Olivine battle tower</a>, <a href="images/Pokemon_Crystal_ruinsalph_ss.jpg">Ruins of Alph</a>, and <a href="images/Pokemon_Crystal_unown_ss.jpg">Unown</a>.  There will be an infrared port adapter for GBA.  And, last but not least, the chances of finding a shiny Pok&#233mon in Gold/Silver is 1:655361!  (Not counting that one Gyarados.)

<img src="images/southern_island.jpg" width=100 align=left><img src="images/southernislandsfront.jpg" width=100 align=right><img src="images/southernislandscards.jpg" width=100 align=right><b>8.12.01</b> Not much happened while I was on vacation.  There'll be a new Pok&#233mon CD out on Oct. 9: "Pok&#233mon Christmas Bash".  I guess it'll have Pokémon versions of classic Christmas songs (you know, like "Here Comes Santa Jynx").  The Brooklyn Museum of Art is now showing 12 pieces of art from well-known Animes like Sailor Moon, DBZ, and Pok&#233mon.  Check out more info at <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org">brooklynmuseum.org</a>.  Pok&#233mon Stadium 2 was holding steady at #5 on the top rentals list as of 8/10.  Pok&#233mon is coming to nationwide Six Flags theme parks.  Click <a href="http://pojo.com/news/2001August3.html">here</a> for times and locations.  The Pok&#233mon TCG Southern Islands set is out.  It includes 18 cards (6 reverse holos), 6 postcards, 3 recent booster packs, and 9 card sleeves, all in a 3-ring wrap-around binder (see the pictures).  That's all for now!
<p>
<b>9.01.01</b> Not much here today.  From <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/news/stadium2launch.html">pokemon.com</a>: Over 150 Poké-fans packed themselves into a makeshift statium at the Boys and Girls Club of Hollywood to watch the daughters of world-famous boxers Muhammad Ali and Smokin' Joe Frazier, Laila and Jacqui, duke it out on Pokémon Stadium.  Ali won the first two minigames, but Frazier surprised the crowd with a come-from-behind minigame series win and a victory at the "Ultimate Battle" to secure her the victory!  Following, Nintendo made a five thousand dollar donation to the Boys and Girls Club of Hollywood.  From <a href="http://www.wizards.com/pokemon/main.asp?x=tour2001">wizards.com/pokemon</a>: Starting this month, the Pokémon Trading Card Game Tour and Super Trainer Showdown quailfiers will be traveling to various places around the country.  Check the link for more.  (You can't be older than 14 to enter the STS).  That's it!
<p>
<b>9.10.01</b>   A bit of news here.  The Pok&#233mon Mini will be coming out in Japan soon.  The approximately 6-centimeter-wide unit looks slightly similar to the Pocket Pikachu units, with a few exceptions.  One is that the unit has cartridges that come with it.  Another is the buttons.  On the top, there's a grey button, but don't ask me what it does.  On the right side, there's a button called 'C', and on the bottom of the unit there's a bulge that goes out from the unit about less than a centimeter.  It'll be 4800 yen in Japan.  Europe will see this next year, but there's no release date for the US yet.  Click <a href="http://www.nintendoeye.com/news.php?action=detailednews&id=122">here</a> for screenshots.  (From <a href="http://www.nintendoeye.com">nintendoeye.com</a>).  Pok&#233;mon is now on Cartoon Network, but the episode or time is unknown.  The Pok&#233;mon GameBoy Advance game will be released in mid-September 2002, and about six months later for the US.  Pok&#233;mon 3 The Movie was the top-selling video this past week, and a picture of Harry Potter on a broomstick in a movie scene appeared on the cover of a recent Vanity Fair magazine.  Pok&#233;mon was the #9 search on Lycos, too, followed by the IRS.  Is that sad or what--the IRS on the top 10 Lycos searches?
<p>
<img src="images/gamecube.jpg" alt="Nintendo GameCube" align=right><img src="images/birthdaypikachu_v2.jpg" alt="Birthday Pikachu: Version 2" align=left><b>10.5.01</b> Some news has come in since my last installment.  The delay was mostly due to the terror that hit the United States of America almost one month to date.  Finally a reason to agree with President Bush!  Still....  Three main companies, Sony, Microsoft, and the video game giant Nintendo, will go head-to-head-to-head with their 128-bit video game powerhouses: Nintendo's GameCube (which sold 300 thousand units by Sept. 20), Microsoft's Xbox, and the current number one 128-bit system, the Sony PlayStation 2.  GameCube was to be released on September 14, and did so, though it wasn't as publicized as was expected.  Xbox was delayed to November 15.  THQ Inc. and Electronic Arts Inc. signed two big names; EA re-signed golf star Tiger Woods, and THQ signed none other than Britney Spears (no offense, but why? and yuk!) to medium-length video game contracts.  A special Pok&#233mon episode will be released.  Supposedly titled "Mewtwo Returns," it's main plot is Ash & friends supposedly stumble upon an island in a volcanic lake in Johto, where Mewtwo is living, and a battle with an actually COMPETENT Team Rocket member ensues (click <a href="images/mewtwoTV1.jpg">here</a> or <a href="images/mewtwoTV2.jpg">here</a> for screenshots).  It is supposedly to be released in December of this year.  Also, a new Birthday Pikachu was released recently.  Although Topps, the renowned baseball card producer, was stumbling in Pok&#233mon related sales, its non-Pok&#233mon related sales boomed, and still on deck are two big theartrical-related productions: Lord of the Rings and Monsters, Inc. cards are on the way.  The Harry Potter books are still doing well, placing at numbers 1, 5, and 11 on the USA Today bestsellers list.  NFL Showdown 2002, the first Wizards of the Coast TCG and first TCG ever to combine electronic realities with card game play, is on store shelves now.  And finally, Pok&#233mon 3 The Movie was 3rd on the DVD top movie list.  *Whew*! -_-;;
<p>
<a href="images/mewtwoTV3.jpg"><img src="images/mewtwoTV3.jpg" width=50 align=left></a><b>10.20.01</b> A bit of news today--click <a href="news_102001_notes.txt">here</a> for my notes.  A special Pok&#233;mon movie feature will be released straight to VHS and DVD on December 4 in the US.  In the feature, the Team Rocket boss discovers Mewtwo's hiding place and sets a trap to try to catch him.  Ash and his friends get caught up in this, and try to save Mewtwo from Team Rocket.  It'll cost $14.95 for the VHS, and $19.98 for the DVD.  The Pok&#233;mon Johto League Championships TV series debuted as Kids WB's #1 TV show.  Pok&#233;mon 3 The Movie was the 10th best-selling video as of my last check.  DBZ had videos at numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 on that list.  Toys 'R' Us sold out of preorders for Nintendo's GameCube 128-bit video game machine in a record 4 minutes (<a href="mailto:GymLeaderZap@msn.com?subject=record sales">tell me</a> if you've heard of a quicker sellout of anything)!  And to cap it off for today, the third Neo Pok&#233;mon TCG expansion, Neo Revelation, will be released within weeks, and will have 64 cards, 3 or 6 of which will be the three legendary cards.

If you hear any news, <a href="mailto:GymLeaderZap@msn.com">tell me</a>!  I'll put it on the site as soon as I can!  Most images are from <a href="http://www.pojo.com">pojo.com</a>, my 2nd favorite Pok&#233mon fan site (guess what my fave is!).
